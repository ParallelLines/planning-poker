# A Simple Planning Pocker

## run frontend

you need node installed

download the frontend/react folder

run from the folder 
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## build frontend

you need to have all the node modules installed, so run first
```
npm install
```

then run
```
npm run build
```
as a result you'll have a dist folder with index.html and all the necessary files to deploy to you server

if you need to locally preview how the build works run
```
npm run preview
```
